    description: "The Keating Framework, developed at the INVITE AI Institute, is an intelligent, privacy-first platform designed to empower educators by proactively identifying and assisting at-risk students. I engineered the core intelligence utilizing <strong>LangChain</strong> to build a powerful, context-aware <strong>RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)</strong> system. This system efficiently queries massive student datasets using highly-optimized <strong>DuckDB</strong> columnar storage and semantic search via <strong>ChromaDB</strong> vector databases. To ensure deep data privacy and low-latency performance without relying on external APIs, I engineered a complete local inference pipeline running quantized <strong>Local LLMs</strong> via <strong>Ollama</strong>, orchestrated by a blazing fast asynchronous <strong>FastAPI</strong> backend and rigorously tested with <strong>Pytest</strong>.",
